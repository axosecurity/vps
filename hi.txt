Subject: Need help to prove my current student status so I can get free access to Office 365 Education and GitHub

Dear Sir,

I am Solaiman Hossain, an SSC 2023 exam candidate studying at Shaheen School Boardbazar, Gazipur branch. I am writing this email to request your assistance in proving my current student status so that I can get free access to Office 365 Education and GitHub.

I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a letter or document that confirms my enrollment in your institution as a student. This document should include my name, the name of the institution, the date of enrollment, and any other relevant information that would help me prove my student status.

Please find my phone number below for any further communication:

I would like to take this opportunity to express how much I love my school and how grateful I am for the guidance and support provided by our respected directors Sef Shohel Mbs sir and Shekh Sadi sir.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
Solaiman Hossain
